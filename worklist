basic order is:
- util xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- the state init/destroy/reset xxxxxxxxxxxxx
- input xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- read_commands, separate_commands, parse_commands
- builtin
- execute (but not for the fork/exec part)
- make your FSM and now you can have a shell that you can "cd" and "exit"
- rest of execute (fork/exec)
